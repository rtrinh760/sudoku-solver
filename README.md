# Sudoku Solver

This project is a simulation of an algorithm that backtracks to solve a given Sudoku puzzle. 

This simulation also includes a stack data structure that is used to backtrack cells if the algorithm gets stuck on finding valid cells. 

The main goal is to see how the solving algorithm and backtracking are affected by varied starting values, such as the number of solved cases and the runtime of the program. This allows us to analyze the complexity of the solver algorithm.
